	git clone https://github.com/nanoant/textual-chatter.git

## Original Style Features

### Auto Light and Dark Mode Switching

Chatter will automatically switch its color scheme from light to dark based on the "Darken main window colors" setting, found in Textual Preferences → Interface → General:

### Auto Correction System

Chatter has an automatic correction system that works by looking for messages that start or end with an asterisk (which many people do anyway).  It then uses an algorithm to try to figure out which word(s) you meant to correct, and actually makes the correction inline, highlighting it yellow.  For example, if you typed these two messages:

```
	Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their county.
	*country
```

Chatter would assume `*country` is a correction, and locate the best-matching word(s) in your previously typed messages in the same channel.  In this case it would correct the word `county`.

Note that only people who have the Chatter theme will "see" the corrections being made, as they are done at render time inside Textual.  Other users will just see the `*country` message on its own line.

#### Regex Replace

Chatter also looks for the standard Perl-style regular expression match + replace syntax, and applies the correction to your previously typed messages.  The syntax is: `s/MATCH/REPLACE/`.  So for example, if you typed these two messages:

```
	Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their county.
	s/county/country/
```

Chatter would assume `s/county/country/` is a correction, and locate matching word(s) in your previously typed messages in the same channel.  In this case it would change the word `county` to `country`.

#### Single Character Auto-Append

How many times do you see people leaving a single character off the end of a sentence, then typing it on a subsequent line?  Chatter detects this, and auto-appends the character to the previous line, highlighting it in yellow.

### Emoji Emotes

Chatter will show Emoji for common emote character sequences.  Here is the conversion table:

Conversions will only take place if the character sequence is surrounded by whitespace or nothing.  So you should never see accidental emotes show up in URLs, etc.

### Smart Time Stamps

Chatter hides all message time stamps unless the minute changes.  However, you can roll your mouse over the right-hand gutter to see a tooltip of the selected message's timestamp, even if it is invisible.

This is based on a feature in [Skylight](https://github.com/mintchaos/Skylight).

### Repeat Authors

Chatter hides the nickname for repeated subsequent messages from the same author.

This is based on a feature in [Skylight](https://github.com/mintchaos/Skylight).

### Fixed Width Nickname Gutter

Chatter has a fixed width area for nicknames, which is much better for reading chats, in my opinion.  If nicknames are too long to fit, they are chopped with an ellipsis.

This is based on a feature in [Skylight](https://github.com/mintchaos/Skylight).
